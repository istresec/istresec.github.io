I am Ivan Stresec, a recently graduated MSc in Computer Science from Croatia, looking for a Ph.D. position. I am most interested in interdisciplinary applied machine learning research: developing models that can use the structure of the data to solve domain-specific problems and making models more reliable and transparent. I finished my studies at the [University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing](https://www.fer.unizg.hr/en) (UniZg-FER) in 2022. I was also a visiting graduate student at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) in 2021.

As a researcher at UniZg-FER, I work on reliable survival prediction models for liver transplantation.
